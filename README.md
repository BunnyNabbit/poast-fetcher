# Poast Fetcher

He is called "poast Fetcher" for an amazing reason.

![On the lower part of the image, there is a blue lizard-like figure riding a black dragon pool toy. The pool toy is lying on the ground with all fours. It has a solid cyan eye on the side of its grinning face. There is a collage of screenshots in a speech bubble coming from the pool toy and makes up the top part of the image. The text primary discusses issues related to fonts and character encoding of the Classic protocol which ClassiCube is built on. It mentions how a client built from the ground up using web technology may approach font rendering and how it may not be compatible with custom texture packs. Most of the text is written in Zhing-like English. In response to this verbose text, the blue lizard-like figure responds with "Woau!".](https://shelby.bunnynabbit.com/vorbose.png)
